🌡️ Weather Forecasting Using Time Series (ARIMA)

📌 Overview

This project predicts future temperature values using historical weather data of Delhi. We apply time series forecasting techniques, specifically the ARIMA model, to predict the temperature trend.

It’s useful in environmental research, agriculture, and for building predictive systems in weather applications.

📁 Dataset

- Dataset: Daily Delhi Climate Data
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-data
- File: DailyDelhiClimateTrain.csv
- Features:
  - meantemp
  - humidity
  - wind_speed
  - meanpressure

🧠 Model Used

- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

📊 Features

- Parse date and index the dataset by time
- Visualize and decompose seasonal trends
- Apply ARIMA to forecast temperature for the next 30 days
- Plot actual vs predicted values

🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas, numpy
  - matplotlib, seaborn
  - statsmodels (for ARIMA)

🚀 How to Run

1. Download the dataset and place it inside the `data/` folder
2. Install the required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open `main_notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run all cells to train the ARIMA model and view forecast plots

🧯 Troubleshooting

❗ ValueError: Not enough observations
✔️ Try training on more historical data (larger time range)

❗ ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'statsmodels'
✔️ Run: pip install statsmodels

❗ Plot appears flat
✔️ Try changing ARIMA parameters (p,d,q) like (5,1,0)

📌 Output

- Forecast graph for the next 30 days
- Temperature trend visualization
- Real-world time series ML experience
